# **Iris Flower Classification** üå∏

![Iris Flower Dataset](https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/51518iris%20img1.png)

### **Overview**
This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify **Iris flowers** into one of three species: **Iris Setosa**, **Iris Versicolor**, and **Iris Virginica**. The classification is based on four features of the flowers: 
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

By utilizing these features, we build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict the species of Iris flowers, ultimately selecting the model that performs best.

## **Problem Statement** üí°
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical features. This is a supervised classification problem where the task is to classify each flower into one of three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**.

---

## **Dataset Information** üìä
The dataset used in this project is the famous **Iris dataset**, available from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). The dataset consists of **150 observations**, each with:
- 4 features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
- 3 target classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica.

---

## **Technologies Used** üíª
- **Python** üêç
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **NumPy** for numerical computations.
